# Lockr 🔐

*A Spring Boot based password manager*

Lockr is a backend password manager application built using Spring Boot.
It provides APIs to securely store and retrieve passwords while applying encryption before persistence.

The project was created to understand how real-world applications handle sensitive data, database interaction, and service-layer architecture.

## Features

* Store passwords securely using encryption
* Retrieve saved credentials via REST APIs
* Layered architecture (Controller, Service, Repository)
* Clean and structured backend design

---

## Tech Stack

* Java
* Spring Boot
* Spring Data JPA
* Maven
* MySQL

## How It Works

* Passwords are received through REST endpoints
* Data is encrypted using a utility class before saving
* Encrypted passwords are stored in the database
* Decryption is applied only when required
